          Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
          "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to
          life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part
          of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is
          often understood as a separate category from other natural
          phenomena.[1] The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature
          and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities,
          innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2]
          In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation
          of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the
          intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of
          the world to develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature
          as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the
          original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the
          word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a
          dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily
          gained currency ever since.
